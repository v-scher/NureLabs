The first set of precautions Microsoft advises organizations (government or private) take is to be on the lookout for phishing scams, and poor system hygiene. Phishing is one of those scams that doesn’t involve hacking, and instead relies on tricking users to provide information such as network credentials and passwords. An attacker would then use that information to gain unauthorized access to a computer or the network that computer is connected to. Other ways attackers may gain access to that information is by utilizing a system vulnerability, be it a vulnerability in the operating system or one of the applications that it is running. Microsoft’s advice is to ensure that all system updates are installed, and in a timely fashion, to ensure attackers do not take advantage of outdated systems and software.


The software giant also emphasizes the need to have least privilege principles enabled in a network, as it can thwart attackers from swiftly moving across a network in their attempts to steal information and compromise systems. Organizations should also identify their “crown jewels”, or high-value assets, isolate, and add additional security measures to protect them from cyber criminals. Additionally, organizations that hold information including card swipe data, pin input data, data in flight and data in storage, should not only be isolated, but encrypted too. It’s rather worrying that this even needs to be said.

Protecting administrator credentials is another important step that organizations should take, particularly to fight off an attack called “pass-the-hash”, which attackers have used successfully on numerous documented occasions. The attack is designed to harvest as many stolen credentials as possible and remain undetected for as long as possible. It’s a horrible one, and Microsoft has released a number of papers that detail how the attack works against Windows operating systems, and what security measures can be taken to fight it.
